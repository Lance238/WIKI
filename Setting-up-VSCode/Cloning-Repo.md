# Cloning Project Repo from Azure DevOps onto VSCode

In this page we will discuss the two main ways users can clone an existing Repo made on Azure DevOps onto VS Code or onto any IDE of their choice

## First Option: Any IDE using the command line

For this option, users can opt for the Command Line method. Users will start by going to the files
section under the Repos Tab in their Project. Once the user can view the files of the Repo, the top right corner should give users the option to choose either "Set up build" or to "Clone". Select, clone, and the HTTPS URL link should show up. Copy that link, and then input the command 

        git clone <paste URL here>

## Second Option: Cloning to VS Code using Azure DevOps Interface

This option may seem a bit more straightforward for those who are unfamiliaar with using the Command Line. The only drawback is that it only applies to those who plan to use VS Code. 

Steps are fairly similar, as you simply locate the files in the Repos Tab (as mentioned above). The only difference here is to select Clone in VS Code, assuming the user already has VS Code up and running on their system. Once selected, the user will be moved to the VS Code IDE where the files can all be seen in the explorer on the left side.
