# Cloning Project Repo from Azure DevOps onto VSCode

In this page we will discuss the two main ways users can clone an existing Repo made on Azure DevOps onto VS Code or onto any IDE of their choice

## First Option: Any IDE using the command line

For this option, users can opt for the Command Line method. Users will start by going to the files
section under the Repos Tab in their Project. Once the user can view the files of the Repo, the top right corner should give users the option to choose either "Set up build" or to "Clone". Select, clone, and the HTTPS URL link should show up. Copy that link, and then input the command 

        git clone <paste URL here>
