### Markdownlint

Markdownlint is an extension for the Visual Studio Code editor that includes a library of rules to encourage standards and consistency for Markdown files. It is powered by the markdownlint library for Node.js (which was inspired by markdownlint for Ruby). Linting is performed by the markdownlint-cli2 engine, which can be used in conjunction with this extension to provide command-line support for scripts and continuous integration scenarios.

1. Press Ctrl+Shift+X/Ctrl+Shift+X/⇧⌘X to open the Extensions tab
2. Type markdownlint to find the extension
3. Click the Install button, then the Enable button

When editing a Markdown file in Code with markdownlint installed, any lines that violate one of markdownlint's rules (see below) will trigger a Warning in the editor. Warnings are indicated by a wavy green underline and can also be seen by pressing Ctrl+Shift+M/Ctrl+Shift+M/⇧⌘M to open the Errors and Warnings dialog. Hover the mouse pointer over a green line to see the warning or press F8 and Shift+F8/Shift+F8/⇧F8 to cycle through all the warnings (markdownlint warnings all begin with MD###). For more information about a markdownlint warning, place the cursor on a line and click the light bulb icon or press Ctrl+./Ctrl+./⌘. to open the quick fix dialog. Clicking one of the warnings in the dialog will display that rule's help entry in the default web browser.
