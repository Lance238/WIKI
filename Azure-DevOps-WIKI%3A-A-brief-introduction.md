# Azure DevOps WIKI

Developers and Project managers need some sort of method to collaborate and share information with each other. Storing said information should also be accessible, editable, and manipulated.

Azure has implemented such needs within their DevOps platform. Particularily, Azure has implemented a feature within DevOps called WIKI. 

Azure DevOps Wiki is a documentation solution within the Azure DevOps Suite. It can help developers address their documentation needs at various stages of their product development, such as creating specifications, writing meeting reports, or any general information that they would like to share within the team.
